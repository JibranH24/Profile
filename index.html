                <p id="sub-writings"> Hi I'm Jibran and I'm studying to become a software engineer. I started coding for fun but quickly realised that it had become a genuine interest of mine and I found myself coding for hours daily. I like that through my code I can create interactive things that can be published for other peoples benefit and I aspire to create something that will one day help lots of people.</p>
                <p id="sub-writings">I am looking to start an apprenticeship to learn from real life software developers and perfect modern, in-demand skills that will help me in my career. </p>
                <p id="sub-writings">In my spare time I Improve my knowledge of programming languages, I enjoy learning new tricks with software programming, watching youtube tutorials and coding with my friends on the weekends at the pizzeria. I create minigames to implement new things I learn, and I love solving the problems that arise and also being creative when styling and animating the game.</p>   <br>
